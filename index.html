            <legend class="content"><b> Current Landscape of Digital Payment</b></legend>
        <div class="main">
            <ul>Electronic banking emerged in the 1980s in the country, marked by the debut of automated teller machines or ATMs. 
            Initially, banks established three distinct ATM consortia, namely Expressnet, Megalink, and Bancnet. 
            However, the efficiency of ATM services fell short of expectations due to the independent operation of the multiple consortia. 
            This led banks to reconsider and launch inter-ATM network transactions. 
            The outcome of this shift was the unifying operations across the entire banking system.
            <br><br>
            Innovations in the financial sector positioned the Philippines as the pioneer in the introduction of mobile money services in 2001. 
            Initially spearheaded by a telecommunications company, the groundbreaking concept aimed to extend financial services to the unbanked and underserved sectors. 
            Through mobile money services, users could seamlessly perform fund transfers, remittances, bill payments, and purchases using their mobile phones. 
            The initial mode of access was through the utilization of the SMS technology.
            <br><br>
            Given the expanding young and tech-savvy demographic, these mobile money services held the promise of introducing these population segments to an uncomplicated and convenient method of digitally preserving value. 
            These opportunities persist given that as of January 2020, around 63 million individuals in the Philippines were using the internet primarily individuals aged 16 and above. 
            A significant portion of the population utilizes mobile phones with an estimated 75.66 million users in 2020. 
            Concurrently, the Philippines topped the average internet usage index in Asia, with Filipinos dedicating an average of 10 hours daily to the internet.
            <br><br>
            As mobile phones emerge as a practical tool for mobile banking and electronic payments, there has been a noteworthy increase in both the quantity and value of e-money transactions. 
            This trend mirrors the continued transition towards digital payments.

            E-wallets have become increasingly popular in recent years. 
            With the advancement of technology and the convenience they offer, it's no wonder more and more people are choosing to use e-wallets for their financial transactions. 
            Not only do e-wallets provide a secure way to make payments, but they also allow users to store their payment information in one place, making it easy to make purchases online or in-store. 
            Additionally, e-wallets often come with added benefits such as rewards programs or discounts for using the service.

            Filipinos benefit from the convenience e-wallets provide, however, it is important to note that while e-wallets have many advantages, there are also some drawbacks to consider.<br><br>

            Hackers may target e-wallets to try to gain access to users' sensitive payment information.</li></ul>

            If there are issues with the e-wallet platform or if you don't have access to the internet, it could disrupt your ability to make payments.</li></ul> 
            <ul><li>Lastly, not all merchants or businesses accept e-wallet payments, which can limit your options in certain situations. 
            Despite these potential drawbacks, e-wallets continue to gain popularity and provide a convenient solution for many individuals.</li></ul>
